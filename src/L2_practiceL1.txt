Data Set Information: 
This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive
Prevalence Survey.  The samples are married women who were either not
pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview.  The
problem is to predict the current contraceptive method choice (no use,
long-term methods, or short-term methods) of a woman based on her
demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
 
Attributes Information:
   
 1. Wife's age (wAGE,numerical)
 2. Wife's education (wEDU,categorical) 1=low, 2, 3, 4=high
 3. Husband's education (hEDU,categorical) 1=low, 2, 3, 4=high
 4. Number of children ever born (CHD,numerical)
 5. Wife's religion (wREL,binary) 0=Non-Islam, 1=Islam
 6. Wife's now working? (wWORK,binary) 0=Yes, 1=No
 7. Husband's occupation (hWORK,categorical) [1=manager, 2=public
    servant, 3=physician, 4=engineer]
 8. Standard-of-living index (SOL,categorical) 1=low, 2, 3, 4=high
 9. Media exposure (MEDIA,binary) 0=Good, 1=Not good
 10. Contraceptive method used (CMET,class attribute) 1=No-use,
     2=Long-term, 3=Short-term

----------------------------------------

A. Read data from file cmc.data.txt, store them in a variable (e.g.,
'mydata') and verify variable class, structure, and summary.

B. Name the columns according to instructions above and transform
categorical values into factors. Verify the new structure.

C. Add a column called "ID" and containing a sequential index. Verify
the structure of the updated variable.

D. Visualize the third observation of attribute "wEDU" and the fifth
observation of attribute "CHD". Modify both entries by assigning a
value NA.

E. Visualize all observations of attribute "wAGE". Assign the results
to a new variable called AGE.

F. Calculate how many values of AGE are higher than 35. Visualize the
whole dataset (mydata) only for subjects with AGE > 35 and no
children.
